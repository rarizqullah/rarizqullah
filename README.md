### Greetings Everyone

I am a **Software Developer** and **Information Systems graduate** who focuses on building stable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. My work blends **clean architecture**, modern tooling, and systematic problem-solving to deliver reliable digital products. My development approach prioritizes clarity, efficient systems design, and long-term maintainability. I enjoy exploring how engineering decisions shape both developer experience and real-world product impact.

### What I'm Working On

Currently, I am developing a scalable **Employee Management System (EMS)** using **Next.js**, **Supabase**, **Prisma**, and **Docker**. This project emphasizes predictable data flows, efficient API design, and a strong developer experience.

On the mobile front, I am building a Mandiri-style **News Application** using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. The application implements **MVVM** and **Clean Architecture**, focusing strictly on UI responsiveness, modularity, and maintainable state management.

Simultaneously, I am constructing an **Inventory Management System** backend using **Go**, **Gin**, **SQLC**, and **PostgreSQL**. This system is structured with clean modular layers to support reliability, high performance, and smooth feature expansion.

Beyond coding, I am actively exploring **Linux**, tooling, and **DevOps** workflows. This includes working with rootless **Docker**, local **Supabase** environments, and **CI/CD automation** to optimize developer tooling and environment standardization.

### Technical Stack & Interests

My technical expertise is centered on modern web development with a focus on speed, correctness, and maintainability.

* **Backend Engineering:** I specialize in **Go**, **Gin**, **SQLC**, **Supabase**, **PostgreSQL**, **Prisma**, and **REST/GraphQL** to build type-safe and efficient services.
* **Frontend Development:** I utilize **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind** to create responsive interfaces.
* **Mobile Development:** I work with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **MVVM** patterns for native Android development.
* **DevOps & Tools:** My workflow relies on **Docker** (including rootless containers), **CI/CD pipelines**, **Linux**, **Git**, **VS Code**, and **JetBrains IDEs**.

I am also deeply interested in software architecture, domain modeling, systematic debugging, and the practical applications of **AI** and **Web3** in production environments.

### What I Value in Software

I value **clarity over unnecessary complexity** and **automation over repetitive tasks**. My ultimate goal is designing systems that are predictable, observable, and easy to maintain throughout their entire lifecycle.
